TravelingSalesmanProblem-IDA-

This is an implementation of the iterative deepening A* search algorithm for the TSP problem. The algorithm uses minimum spanning trees as heuristic, using Kruskal's algorithm for calculating MSP. Note that the skeleton code is provided by the Intro to AI class at CMU.
